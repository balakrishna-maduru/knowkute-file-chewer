What to expect next Quarter
For Q3FY25, we expect growth of 2.2% QoQ in CC terms, led by continued deal
ramp-up despite the impact of the furloughs. For OPM, we expect a slight expansion
of 13bps QoQ mainly led by operating efficiencies.

QoQ in USD terms driven in areas like powertrain and Middleware in PV. Region-
wise Mix: Europe (58.8% of Rev) de-grew by 0.6% QoQ, while Asia (23.7% of
Rev), up 23% QoQ, while USA region (27.5% of Rev) posted muted growth of

C) 1 Asian OEM for Integration.
▪ Operating Margin: EBIT margin declined by 60bps QoQ to 16.7% in Q2, while
EBITDA margin declined by 61bps to 20.5% due to 1m wage hike impact and
quarterly promotions. Margin increased on account of growing fixed-price
contracts and offshoring for certain clients.

by 3.7% QoQ, while Non-Top 25 clients grew by 12.7% QoQ. It saw tremendous

European OEMs are under pressure, but mgmt. expects opportunity in areas like
off-highway and trucks going forward.
▪ Cash: Net Cash balance stood at Rs. 10Bn.
▪ QIP: Board has approved QIP of Rs. 28.8bn for multiple inorganic opportunities n
the areas like Off-highway, compliance and Infrastructure development, which will
lead to a dilution of approx. 6% at current market cap of Rs. 480bn.

Valuation
KPIT is a strong ER&D player with focused capabilities in the automotive industry’s
sunrise technologies. Technologies like software-defined vehicles, autonomous
driving and electrification will continue to act as multi-year tailwinds for the
Automotive ER&D and thus super-specialized players like KPIT will continue to win
and grow in this market.
We expect a Revenue CAGR of 19% over FY24-FY30E with average EBITDA
margins of ~20%, Cost of Capital of 11% and Terminal growth of 3%. Taking these
assumptions, we revise our rating to ‘Accumulate’ with a DCF based TP of Rs.
1,800 per share (implies ~2.5x on PEG basis).
