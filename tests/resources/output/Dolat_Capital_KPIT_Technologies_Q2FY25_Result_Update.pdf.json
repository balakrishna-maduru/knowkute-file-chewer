    "Results in-line; Growth Guidance reiterated at lower band \n▪ KPIT reported CC revenue growth of 4.7% QoQ (DE:  4.5%), led by \nAsia (+ 23.1% QoQ) & Passenger Cars (+5.3% QoQ). OPM at 16.7%, \nwas down 60bps QoQ (DE: 16.6%), due to a 1m wage hike impact.  \n▪ The company reiterated achieving a lower band of its revenue growth \nguidance (organic) of 18-22% as clients focus on cost reduction & \nprefer offshoring, while expecting outperformance in EBITDA margin \nof 20.5%+ despite pressure in certain OEMs in Europe.   \n▪ We tweak our FY25/26E earnings estimates by +1.7%/-4.1% QoQ on \nsustained growth momentum led by ramp ups from Asian OEMs. \nWith this ongoing momentum we revise to our rating to ‘Accumulate’ \nwith DCF based TP of Rs.1,800 (implies 52x FY27, ~2.5x on PEG).    \n \nGrowth guidance intact at lower band; TCV wins remain soft \nKPIT’s lower band growth guidance implies 1.7%-2.5% CQGR over H2FY25 \nwhich reflects its strong positioning in existing portfolio, diversification \nsynergies in newer areas  & long-standing client relationships. New TCV \nwins stood healthy at $207mn in Q2 (up 33% YoY; TTM down 17.5% YoY) \nbut ramp-up has slowed in some markets (more pronounced in Germany).   \n \nAsia led growth; New opportunities to drive US growth \nAmongst T-25 strategic clients (8 5.5% of Rev)  revenue grew 3.7% QoQ \nwhile non-top-25 clients revenues grew by 12.7%. Asia grew by 23% QoQ, \ndriven by strong spending from Japanese/Korean/Indian OEMs while US \n(+2%) momentum pick up led by 1) Integration Opportunities with US OEMs \nas US banned China software , and 2) Opportunities in off -highways and \nTrucks segments. However, Europe  de-grew 0.6% QoQ  due to China \ncompetition.  \n \nCost reduction to moderate growth; while improving profitability \nWe believe KPIT’s double-digit teens growth momentum is likely to sustain \nas it prioritizes long-term engagements and proactive deals while there will \nbe headwinds as clients prioritize cost reduction through offshoring & lower \nfixed price billing, which m ay impact growth momentum while there will be \nmargin uptick. Mgmt expects growth in CV FY26 onwards from US/EU. \n \nEarnings Concall Highlights \nCommentary: 1) KPIT will raise Rs. 28.8bn through QIP for inorganic \ninitiatives, 2) Focus to increase in Off-highway & Trucks SBU. \n \n. \n        \nKey Data  \nNifty 24,436 \nEquity / FV Rs 2,712mn / Rs 10 \nMarket Cap Rs 443bn  \n USD 5.3bn \n52-Week High/Low Rs 1,929/ 1,091 \nAvg.
