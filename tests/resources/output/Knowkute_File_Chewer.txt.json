    "Knowkute File Chewer\nKnowkute File Chewer is a modular, document processing and querying system powered by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and embeddings. It enables users to upload, parse, chunk, embed, and search across a wide variety of document types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and plain text) using a FastAPI-based backend. All processing and storage are performed locally, ensuring data privacy and full control over your files and models.\nKey Features\nLocal-Only LLMs & Embeddings: All models are downloaded and run locally—no data leaves your machine.\nMulti-Format Support: Handles PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and TXT files.\nModular Architecture: Clean separation of API routes, business logic, pipelines, and data models for easy maintenance and extensibility.\nEfficient Chunking & Embedding: Documents are parsed, cleaned, split into meaningful chunks, and embedded for fast vector search.\nFastAPI REST API: Upload files, trigger processing, and query your data via simple HTTP endpoints.\nExtensible Storage: Chunks and embeddings are stored locally (JSON/SQLite) but can be extended to use databases or distributed storage.\nHealth & Status Endpoints: Built-in endpoints for monitoring and debugging.\nTypical Workflow\nUpload: User uploads a document via the API.\nChewing: The system parses, cleans, splits, and embeds the document, storing the results locally.\nQuery: User submits a query; the system embeds the query and performs a vector search to return the most relevant document chunks.\nUse Cases\nPrivate document search and Q&A\nKnowledge base construction\nLocal research assistant\nSecure enterprise document processing\nWhy Knowkute File Chewer?\nPrivacy: No cloud dependencies—your data and models stay on your machine.\nFlexibility: Easily add new file types, models, or storage backends.\nPerformance: Optimized for fast, local vector search and retrieval.\nSee the design document for detailed architecture and component responsibilities."
